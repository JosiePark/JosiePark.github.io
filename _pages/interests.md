Sports
======

I'm an ex-competitive swimmer, swimming at a county level in school. Since, I have swum with my university clubs at UCL and Imperial. I was President (2014-15) and Treasurer (2013-14) of UCL Swimming Club.

I'm now a member of Masters Squad at Cambridge Swimming Club. I have switched my specialism from pool swimming to long-distance open water swimming. I complete the 14km Henley Thames Marathon in under 3hrs 30 in 2019, and completed the shortened 10km Henley Thames Marathon in 2021 in under 2 hours, finishing 6th female, and 16th overall. My 3km PB is 46:23.0

I also participate in amateur Triathlons.
