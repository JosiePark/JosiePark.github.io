Personal Profile
======
A highly enthusiastic data scientist, specialising in NLP, Time Series Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction, with a passion for mathematical modelling of real world scenarios. I have experience in analysing and presenting complex analysis and communicating findings to a range of audiences, from academics to clients. I have contributed to several NLP projects as a Data Scientist, using techniques ranging from Topic Modelling, Information Extraction and Sentiment Analysis. During my PhD I ran complex, compute-intensive ocean general circulation models on high performance computing clusters in addition to building and meticulously testing numerical methods while presenting and predicting statistical observations. I used dimensionality reduction tools to simplify the ocean field and extract the dominant ocean features, and stochastic models to emulate the non-deterministic nature of the ocean.
