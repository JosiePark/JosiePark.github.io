Personal Profile
======
A highly enthusiastic data scientist with a passion for mathematical modelling of real world scenarios. I have experience in analysing and presenting complex analysis and communicating findings to a range of audiences, from academics to clients. I have contributed to several NLP projects as a Data Scientist, using techniques ranging from Topic Modelling, Information Extraction and Sentiment Analysis. During my time at the Joint Biosecurity Centre (now UK Health Security Agency), I have led a team of Data Scientists, Research Engineers and Software Engineers to run, develop, interpret and present an ensemble of Epidemiological Models. During my PhD I ran complex, compute-intensive ocean general circulation models on high performance computing clusters in addition to building and meticulously testing numerical methods while presenting and predicting statistical observations. I used dimensionality reduction tools to simplify the ocean field and extract the dominant ocean features, and stochastic models to emulate the non-deterministic nature of the ocean.

Education
======

* MSci (1st Class). in Mathematics, University College London, 2015
* MRes (Distinction) in Mathematics, Mathematics of Planet Earth Doctoral Training Centre, Imperial College London and University of Reading, 2016
* Ph.D in Mathematics, Imperial College London, 2020. Thesis Title: Eddy-Induced Lagrangian Transport in an Idealised Meandering Oceanic Jet

Work experience
======

* September 2021 - Present: Principal Data Scientist, UKHSA, UK
  * Technical Lead of the Epidemiological Modelling Ensemble Team
    * Focus of the team is on developing and combining Epidemiological models for COVID-19
    * Models include Agent-Based, Compartmental and Statistical Models
    * Main responsibilities are the co-ordination of the delivery of our main production, communicating the analysis and management, mentorship and leadership of team members. 

* November 2019 - September 2021: Data Science Consultant, Altius (later Avanade), London, UK

  * Consultant working for the Joint Biosecurity Centre
    * QA of hospital forcasting models
    * Main developer of a model estimating the impact of Test, Trace and Isolate interventions
    * Collaborator with external partners on bringing external offerings in-house to the JBC

  * NLP project analysing and summarising consultation response data}
    * Cleaning and processing text using the python nltk and SpaCy packages.
    * Developing a topic model and a sentiment analysis model.
    * Using named entity recognition to extract locations.
    * Each week, provide clear and concise updates of progress to the client.
    * Guide the creation of a PowerBI dashboard and HTML report presenting the results of our analysis and models to allow the client to write a report on the consultation.
    * Presented the work to the whole company at annual meeting.

  * Speech recognition and NLP project to create a tool to automatically process restaurant orders.  
    * Using a speech recognition tool to record the order made by the customer.
    * Matching the translated speech to an item in the menu, and determining the quantity ordered.
    * Save the order to a SQL database which can then be viewed with the option to remove orders via a Flask app.

  * NLP project processing prescriptions
    * Focus was on reconstructing handwriting.
    * Used Microsoft Azure's Read API to guide the process.
    * Managed to construct most popular drug names with accuracy of 98\%.
  
  * Developing internal time series analysis functionality
    * Used Object-Oriented Programming to build a time series analysis class
    * Wrote general purpose modules that split the data, trained the model and visualised the analysis

* Summer 2018 - Summer Research Assistant, Met Office
  * I worked alongside the Dynamics Research group at the Met Office. I tested a finite volume numerical method used for modelling the transport equation and isolated causes of any inaccuracies due to the new cubed-sphere grid, and suggested possible solutions which were then collected into a report advising the team based on my results. All code was written in Python, and I presented the results to colleagues at Imperial. 

* 2017 - 2019 - Graduate Teaching Assistant, Imperial College London
  * Supervised problems classes and marked assessments for MATLAB, Python and Mechanics courses.

* Summer 2012 - Statistician, Wheelright, Begbroke Science Park, Woodstock
  * Responsible for collecting and presenting daily tyre pressure data and investigating the cause of incorrect readings or data outliers.

Extra-curricular Activities
======

* 2017 - 2019 - Scientific Computing Support Network Founder, Imperial College London
  * We set up a support network where post-graduate students can ask for help with computing problems. Part of this involved running a fair informing new PhD and Masters students how to start coding, use the High Performance Computing Cluster, about version control and about good coding practices. The end goal is that it could provide more avenues to cross-departmental collaboration and publications.

* 2014 - 2015 - President, Univesity College London Swimming Club
  * Key roles included acting as the main point of contact with the Union, applying for grants, working alongside the treasurer to keep track of club finances, acquiring sponsorship, organising events, securing pool space for training sessions and communicating with our 200 members and delegating tasks to the committee. 

* 2013 - 2014 - Treasurer, University College London Swimming Club
  * Was responsible for all club finances. Key roles included budgeting for the upcoming year, applying for grants, ensuring sponsorship and budgeting for events.

Outreach, Talks and Networking Events
======

* September 2020 - Women in Tech STEM Women graduate event
  * Gave a presentation to female STEM graduates looking to pursue a career in tech detailing my experiences during my first year at Altius.
  * Featured on a panel event with other women in tech.
